# Flick-It
Game I'm trying to make, but having issues with

I'm attempting to make a game where you move a ball across the screen to a goal by rotating the platforms with the player's inputs, but 
the ball is not behaving the way I want it to. It bounces way too easily when the platforms are rotated, and the ball feels like it floats. 
I have tried playing with mass values, adding physics properties to the ball and platform with 0 bounciness, and played with the 
physics properties themselves, but I have been unable to get it to behave the way I want it too.
